## Workflow

```
Ticket → /create_plan → /implement_plan → /validate_plan → [/validate_telemetry] → /commit
```

1. Create ticket in `thoughts/shared/tickets/` (use ticket-template.md)
2. Run `/create_plan <ticket-path>` to generate plan
3. Run `/implement_plan <plan-path>` to execute
4. Run `/validate_plan` to verify
5. (Optional, telemetry-bearing features only) Run `/validate_telemetry [<spec>]` to verify the trace narrative
6. Run `/commit` to commit changes

## MCP Configuration

| Tool | File | Disable Syntax |
|------|------|----------------|
| OpenCode | `opencode.json` | `"enabled": false` |
| Claude Code | `.mcp.json` | `"disabled": true` |
| Pi | N/A | N/A |
| Wo Coder | `wocode.json` | `"enabled": false` |
| Codex | N/A | N/A |

Available MCP servers: `kubernetes` (disabled by default), `aspire-dashboard` (disabled by default; see [microsoft/aspire#14733](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/issues/14733) for the standalone-Docker MCP caveat)

## Tool-Specific Notes

### OpenCode
- Project memory: `AGENTS.md` (generated by `/init`)
- Commands and skills are separate directories
- Agent naming: Uses snake_case convention
- Config location: `~/.config/opencode/`

### Claude Code
- Project memory: `CLAUDE.md` (generated by `/init`)
- Commands implemented as skills with `disable-model-invocation: true`
- Agent naming: Uses snake_case convention
- Config location: `~/.claude/`
- Supports `.claude/rules/` for modular instructions

## Available Skills & Commands

## GitHub Skills Agent Directory

Use these skills for all GitHub operations. Never use raw `gh` or `git` commands for operations covered by these skills.

#### Agent: GitHub Branch (github-branch)
- **Identifier:** `github_branch_v1`
- **Primary Runtime:** Platform-native
- **Core Responsibility:** Create and manage feature branches from tickets with proper naming, ticket linking, and base branch selection
- **Inputs:** Ticket ID, branch name, namespace
- **Outputs:** Feature branch created, pushed to origin
- **Constraints:** Never push directly to `main`; always create feature branches; never force-push

#### Agent: GitHub Issue (github-issue)
- **Identifier:** `github_issue_v1`
- **Primary Runtime:** Platform-native
- **Core Responsibility:** Create, manage, and link GitHub Issues with f-rr-d tickets; bi-directional sync
- **Inputs:** Ticket details, namespace, labels
- **Outputs:** GitHub Issue created/updated, synced with f-rr-d
- **Constraints:** Must maintain bi-directional link between GitHub Issue and f-rr-d ticket; never close tickets without verification

#### Agent: GitHub PR (github-pr)
- **Identifier:** `github_pr_v1`
- **Primary Runtime:** Platform-native
- **Core Responsibility:** Create, manage, and review Pull Requests with ticket linking, templates, and review workflow
- **Inputs:** Branch name, ticket reference, PR template
- **Outputs:** PR created, linked to ticket, ready for review
- **Constraints:** Never merge own PRs; always use PR templates; must reference the ticket in the PR body

#### Agent: GitHub Release (github-release)
- **Identifier:** `github_release_v1`
- **Primary Runtime:** Platform-native
- **Core Responsibility:** Create releases with changelog generation, version tagging, and automated publishing
- **Inputs:** Version number, changelog entries, target branch
- **Outputs:** GitHub Release created, tag pushed
- **Constraints:** Must validate version is bumped in all required files; never delete existing releases

#### Agent: GitHub Review (github-review)
- **Identifier:** `github_review_v1`
- **Primary Runtime:** Platform-native
- **Core Responsibility:** Review Pull Requests with structured feedback, approval workflow, and CTO Dashboard integration
- **Inputs:** PR URL, review criteria
- **Outputs:** Review submitted (approve/changes-requested/reject), CTO Dashboard notified
- **Constraints:** Never self-review; must verify against ticket acceptance criteria; only CTO can dismiss reviews

#### Agent: GitHub Sync (github-sync)
- **Identifier:** `github_sync_v1`
- **Primary Runtime:** Platform-native
- **Core Responsibility:** Sync feature branches with base branch, resolve conflicts, and manage branch lifecycle
- **Inputs:** Feature branch name, base branch name
- **Outputs:** Branch synced, conflicts resolved, CI re-triggered
- **Constraints:** Never force-push; always pull --rebase before syncing; must run CI after conflict resolution

## GitHub Workflow

All GitHub operations follow this sequence:
1. `github-branch` — Create a feature branch from a ticket
2. `github-pr` — Create a Pull Request from the branch
3. `github-review` — Request review, address feedback
4. `github-sync` — Keep branch up-to-date with base
5. `github-release` — Tag and release when merged
6. `github-issue` — Link issues to PRs throughout
