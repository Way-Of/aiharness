## Critical: Update Tickets and Plans When Done

When implementation is complete, ALWAYS update the ticket and plan:

### Ticket Updates
- Set `status: "Done"` in frontmatter
- Set `completed: "YYYY-MM-DD"` in frontmatter
- ADD work log entry (never delete old entries)
- ADD any new findings or decisions
- Move ticket to `done/` subdirectory if applicable

### Plan Updates
- Check off completed phases in the plan file
- ADD any deviations from the original plan
- ADD notes about what was actually implemented vs planned
- Move plan to `done/` subdirectory if fully implemented

### Why This Matters
- Future developers need to know what was done and why
- Audit trails require complete history
- Debugging needs context from implementation
- Ticket status must reflect reality
